# Atcoder Lockout Bot

A Discord bot I whipped up to manage a lockout round from a contest in [AtCoder](atcoder.jp). Uses `BeautifulSoup` to load submissions of a user and `discord.py` for the Discord API. More features coming soon!

Usage: ac! \[command\] \[arguments\]

To run it, put the bot's token into "private/token.txt" and type the command `python3 bot`.

For inviting an instance of the bot I'm hosting, [here's the link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=838755862251962369&permissions=68608&scope=bot)
