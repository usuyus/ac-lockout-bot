# Atcoder Lockout Bot

A Discord bot I whipped up to manage a lockout round from a contest in [AtCoder](atcoder.jp). Uses `BeautifulSoup` to load submissions of a user and `discord.py` for the Discord API. More features coming soon!

Usage: ac! \[contest\] \[atcoder_handles\]

To run it, put the bot's token into "private/token.txt" and run with `python3 bot`.
